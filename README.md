# Clojure Educational Repository

This repository contains Clojure projects for educational purposes. I'm exploring functional programming paradigms, particularly in Clojure, as motivated by my college studies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore projects to learn Clojure concepts.

## Where are the codes at?
Just go to src/clojure-codes an then are all there. Their names will tell you what that code is about.
